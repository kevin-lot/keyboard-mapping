/* ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.Dict

This file remaps the key bindings of a single user on Mac OS X 10.5 to more
closely match default behavior on Windows systems. This makes the Command key
behave like Windows Control key. To use Control instead of Command, either swap
Control and Command in Apple->System Preferences->Keyboard->Modifier Keys...
or replace @ with ^ in this file.

Here is a rough cheatsheet for syntax.
Key Modifiers
^ : Ctrl
$ : Shift
~ : Option (Alt)
@ : Command (Apple)
# : Numeric Keypad

Non-Printable Key Codes

Standard
F1:           \UF704
F2:           \UF705
F3:           \UF706

Note: typically the Windows 'Insert' key is mapped to what Macs call 'Help'.
Regular Mac keyboards don't even have the Insert key, but provide 'Fn' instead,
which is completely different.

Insert:       \UF727     Help:         \UF746
Delete:       \UF728
Home:         \UF729
End:          \UF72B
Page Up:      \UF72C
Page Down:    \UF72D

Up Arrow:     \UF700
Down Arrow:   \UF701
Left Arrow:   \UF702
Right Arrow:  \UF703

Enter:        \U000A

Escape:       \U001B
Tab:          \U0009

Print Screen: \UF72E
